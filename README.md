## Welcome to the 2020 Summer School of the Memory of Motion EU Project

This MEMMO Summer School focuses on Control for Legged Robots. The school is articulated around three introduction tutorials based on tools developed within the [MEMMO](http://www.memmo-project.eu/) consortium:
- [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio): A fast and flexible implementation of Rigid Body Dynamics algorithms and their analytical derivatives.
- [TSID](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/tsid): Efficient Task Space Inverse Dynamics based on Pinocchio.
- [Crocoddyl](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl): An optimal control library for robot control under contact sequence. Its solver is based on various efficient Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP)-like algorithms.

The school took place from the 7th till the 9th of July 2020, it was **free of charge** and all the materials are freely accessible in this repository and through the linked ones. Recordings of the presentations are available [here](https://seminar.laas.fr/b/gui-u11-1ox).

Expected prerequisites (levels):
- Linear Algebra (good).
- Robotics and Control (basic).
- Optimization (basic).
- Python (basic).
